## Contributing

TBD.  The basic skeleton of this program was provided as "starter code" by the UCLA Coding Bootcamp (see the [first commit](https://github.com/giancarlow333/readme-generator/commit/f2ae99e235b206a24ec14c3d6f4dfb27231c58b3)).  Also, [this article](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) was consulted for tips on producing a high-quality readme.
