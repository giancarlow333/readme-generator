## Installation

**Please note:** You must have Node.js installed on your computer to run this app.  To install it, please consult [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for details.

Once you have Node.js installed on your computer, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo into a folder on your computer.
2. From the command line, run ``npm install`` to install all needed packages.  (You only have to do this the first time you run the app!)
3. Invoke the app using the command ``node index.js``.

## Usage

As noted above, run the app with the command ``node index.js``.  The typical program flow is shown a video that is available [in the assets folder](./assets/ReadmeGeneratorDemoVideo.mp4), and [on GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-BLyYOEIqYD11UyXk5SrYFPeWFgr8zD1/view?usp=drive_link).

## Contributing

TBD.  Currently (August 15, 2023), the generator cannot handle sections with multiple lines.  An example of the program's output is in the assets folder [here](./assets/Readme%20Generator.md); note that the sections in that readme are trimmed compared to this version, which was modified by hand.

### Sources

* The basic skeleton of this program was provided as "starter code" by the UCLA Coding Bootcamp (see the [first commit](https://github.com/giancarlow333/readme-generator/commit/f2ae99e235b206a24ec14c3d6f4dfb27231c58b3)).
* [This article](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) was consulted for tips on producing a high-quality readme.
* The code for creating a directory with Node.js was copied from [the documentation](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/working-with-folders-in-nodejs/) and used in [index.js](./index.js).
